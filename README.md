# Simple-Go-HTTP-Server
A simple HTTP server made with Go to test some of its capabilities to communicate with an HTML page directly.

### How to use this?
First, set up your Go environment. If you need help to do that, you can check the official docs [here](https://go.dev/doc/) about how to use and set up Go. After doing that, just clone this repo and run the main.go file by executing `go run main.go` in a terminal opened from that folder. The execution may take some seconds to start depending on the hardware of your computer.

After started, you will see a message showing you the address where you can see the generated page and interact with it. To finish the execution, just press Ctrl + C on the terminal session or you can just close the terminal.

This project was made with VSCode and utilizes HTML and Go to provide the basic functionality of the resultant page; but it also uses Bootstrap to make everything looks a bit better out of the box. This repo contains all the required sources to work just right after setting the Go environment and running the main.go file.

You can play around with everything. If you got any ideas about how to make this project better; please let me know about them and if you can also share some sources to get information and keep improving my knowledge of GoLang, please let me know about them as well.
